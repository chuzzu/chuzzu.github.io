    <h1 align="middle">Gender Balance in the new Cabinet</h1>
    <h2 align="middle"> Model of excellence</h2>
    <h3 class="green-box">Gender Balance in the new cabinet is a model of excellence. Stephen Harper’s cabinet consisted of 7 women and the rest of the 20 positions were filled by men. Majority of his cabinet was filled with Caucasians with only 1 or 2 people from different ethnicities. Many objected to this because of the clear difference in gender balance and diversity. However, in Justin Trudeau’s cabinet, 50% are women and more than 10% of the people are from different ethnicities (http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/01/15/trudeau-gender-balanced-cabinet-conservative-men_n_8991440.html). Trudeau greatly believes in gender equality and he thinks that the new cabinet needed a feminine touch.
<br></br>
      He has people from 2 to 3 different ethnicities which will also help him because he will be able to better understand how people from different cultures and countries feel about his policies and new ideas. Many people objected to Trudeau’s new spin on things. They said “what if some men have better ideas than some women pertaining to the positions they have filled.” Some women even got offended. They said “we don’t want to be given these jobs just because we are females, but because we can actually contribute something.” Justin held firm to his decision and said that “Gender Parity and Gender Equality should now be a norm in the 21st century.” Justin believes that it’s in the common good of people if both the genders are represented in the cabinets and it will also bring a new perspective to how things used to work before.
