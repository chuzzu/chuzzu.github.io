    <h1 align="middle">Branches of Government</h1>
    <h2 align="middle"> Work in Progress</h2>
    <h3 class="green-box">The Branches of Government (elected versus appointed) in my opinion is a work in progress. Many people that are actively involved in Canada’s politics want a change within the parliament but mostly the senate. Citizens are still okay with voting for people from their respective ridings but those who are elected only go and form the house of commons; the senate is still one step higher. The people in the senate are appointed not elected by the prime minister himself. He chooses people that he likes and people he thinks will do “well”. The senate’s job is to review laws and amendments that the house of commons have passed up and they will either pass the law or send it back to the members of parliament to make changes (http://people.stu.ca/~hunt/truth/TIS0102/FINLWEBS/GTNJZ/REPORT5.HTM).
<br></br>
      The house of commons is full of M.P’s (members of parliament) who sit and represent the people that have elected them. They review new bills and laws and then pass them up to the senate for them to decide whether to pass it or not (http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca). If the house of commons is full of liberals and the senate is majorly conservative, then there will be a huge conflict of interest. Nothing would get done because as one would attempt to pass a law the other would deny it or nothing that conservatives want would get passed up because the liberals would turn it down. In my opinion the senate and house of commons should be made equal so they each have the power to pass new laws and bills that they deem fit. It’s not in the common good of the people if these two houses don’t get along because it will create governance issues.
