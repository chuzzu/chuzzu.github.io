    <h1 align="middle">Lowering the Voting Age</h1>

    <h2 align="middle">Work in progress</h2>

    <h3 class="green-box">The voting age currently in Canada is 18 years whereas it used to be 21 but was changed in 1970. In my opinion this is a work in progress because many including me believe that the age should be further lowered to 16. The right to vote has been an ongoing battle in Canada since 1916 when the fight started with women asking for that fundamental right (CBC). It continued for several years until they were finally awarded that right during World War 1. Then came in the Asians in 1982 who were also asking for that right. They had already been living in Canada for several decades and they had greatly contributed to Canada’s economy but still had to fight over simple things such as the right to vote. Fast forward to 2008, that’s when multiple 16 and 17 year olds raised their concerns and wanted the age to be lowered. Many people think that letting these younger ages vote gets them ready for further elections and encourages voting in general. Many people believe that 16 and 17 years
      <br></br>
   olds are ideal voters because they are familiar with their communities and go to school so they are fully aware of the problems that affect them on a daily basis. Many people believe that this age group is not aware of the responsibilities that adults face but this is not the case at all. 16 and 17 year olds can drive, have children (not encouraged) and even start their own families. Many of them that do so want a say in the type of society that their children will grow up in. Only 17.5 million out of 25.6 million registered voters actually do cast a ballot (Huffington Post) so even if the right is given to this age group it will further help boost this number up and more people will vote. All 16 and 17 year olds want is to be treated equal to adults and it’s in the common interest of people to have more voters. I think it would be great if these people were given the right to vote and it would greatly help our country.
